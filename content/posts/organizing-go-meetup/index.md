It has been an pleasure to work with the Golang community in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. I have had the opportunity to co-organize events for Golang community as part GoWest Meetup.

[GoWest Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sweden-go-west/)

Good community, good language and great support for everybody. What drives great communities are the people involved in making sure everybody is involved and heard, sharing and caring. 

Sharing some of the media from the experience:
