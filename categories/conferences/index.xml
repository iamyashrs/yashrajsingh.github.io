I felt lucky to get a change to make the experience with other 60 founders, explorers and misfits from across the world.
Uprise was an community of explorers who want to change things in the world. Indeed it was a private collective for the new wave of founders, explorers &amp;amp; misfits.</description></item><item><title>FOSDEM 2019</title><link>https://yashrs.com/2019/02/fosdem-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yashrs.com/2019/02/fosdem-2019/</guid><description>In 2019, I got a chance to take part in FOSDEM in Brussels, Belgium.
