In June 2014, I started working on Project Yello, The idea was simple. While my time in college, i realized that there is a huge gap between &amp;lsquo;what student learned&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;what student is taught&amp;rsquo;.
The things we were taught in college, were of no use most of the times, because students didn&amp;rsquo;t worked on projects i.e. to apply that knowledge they learned atleast once, so they would get a better prespective of how, why, when, what of that knowledge.</description></item></channel></rss>
