In August 2021, I got an opportunity to visit Portugal on a experiencial trip in the southern part Algarve of the country. I felt lucky to get a change to make the experience with other 60 founders, explorers and misfits from across the world.

Uprise was an community of explorers who want to change things in the world. Indeed it was a private collective for the new wave of founders, explorers & misfits.  With members taking entrepreneurial action together – for lives full of meaning, growth & impact.
