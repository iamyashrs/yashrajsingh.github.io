It has been time, since i have made an attempt to update my blog with the ongoing’s of my life. But now would be the right time probably.
Alot have changed in some months, like i am now a 4th Year Final student at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology(JUET), Guna. That’s pretty bad-ass bro.
And as every engineer need to complete a mandatory training/internship at the end of the 3rd Year of B.</description></item></channel></rss>
