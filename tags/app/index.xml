ideaPad is an easy-to-use, app that helps you remember your greatest ideas. Quickly save your ideas or to-do&amp;rsquo;s, Answer sample questions, draw sketches - that&amp;rsquo;s the magic. It helps you gain momentum on your life goals and ideas. I build the app in August 2014, because i needed a place where i could store my ideas.
Hopefully so they won&amp;rsquo;t get lost in time and i would work on them.</description></item><item><title>Project Yello</title><link>https://yashrajsingh.github.io/2013/06/project-yello/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yashrajsingh.github.io/2013/06/project-yello/</guid><description>Project Yello Project Yello
In June 2014, I started working on Project Yello, The idea was simple. While my time in college, i realized that there is a huge gap between &amp;lsquo;what student learned&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;what student is taught&amp;rsquo;.
The things we were taught in college, were of no use most of the times, because students didn&amp;rsquo;t worked on projects i.e. to apply that knowledge they learned atleast once, so they would get a better prespective of how, why, when, what of that knowledge.</description></item></channel></rss>
