## HackerTheDude

[HackerTheDude](http://hackerthedude.blogspot.in/)

From May 2009 till 2011, I blogged about penetration testing and security for various platforms, there were number of reasons to do so. 

First, it was a good learning process. I learned and wrote about it. 

Second, It helpmed me understand the importance of design, programming and a lot of other things in this online world. It was my first foray into web and security. Gathering at one time over 1.8 Million+ page hits, 500+ email readers. 

Cheers.
