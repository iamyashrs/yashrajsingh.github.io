## ideaPad

[ideaPad for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideapad)

ideaPad is an easy-to-use, app that helps you remember your greatest ideas. Quickly save your ideas or to-do's, Answer sample questions, draw sketches - that's the magic. It helps you gain momentum on your life goals and ideas. I build the app in August 2014, because i needed a place where i could store my ideas. 

Hopefully so they won't get lost in time and i would work on them. You can download the app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideapad).
