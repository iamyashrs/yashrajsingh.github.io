In 2019, I got a chance to take part in FOSDEM in Brussels, Belgium. 

I had a wonderful experience of experiencing the culture of FOSS that the IT industry thrives on. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. I visited with my colleages at Opera. Here are some of the momentes from the conference.
